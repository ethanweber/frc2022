### 3D model of field
It's often helpful to look at the 3D model of the field. I put a viewer (with [https://modelviewer.dev](<model-viewer>)) at https://ethanweber.me/frc2022, though it takes a while to load. Alternatively, you can download the GLTF file from Dropbox at https://www.dropbox.com/s/pddok44cxd2i946/field_med_from_STEP.gltf?dl=0.
